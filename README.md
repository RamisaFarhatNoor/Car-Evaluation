# Car-Evaluation

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on predicting car evaluations based on various features. The dataset includes attributes such as buying cost, maintenance cost, number of persons the car can fit, number of doors, and lug boot size. The target variable, which is the evaluation, includes categories like 'good', 'vgood' (very good), 'acc' (acceptable), and 'uacc' (unacceptable).

## Motivation

The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify car evaluations. Due to the inherent imbalance in the dataset, different approaches, including both traditional model training and cross-validation techniques, are explored to assess the impact on model performance.

## Contents

- **Code:** Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts covering data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Data:** The dataset used for training and evaluation.
- **Results:** Visualizations, metrics, and model evaluation results.
- **Documentation:** Descriptions of dataset attributes, model choices, and evaluation methodologies.

## Results
The model's predictive performance is assessed using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The impact of cross-validation on model stability and generalization is also discussed.
